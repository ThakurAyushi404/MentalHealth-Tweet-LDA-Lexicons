# Lexicon Extraction using LDA for Depression Analysis 🧠📊

This repository demonstrates how **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** can be used to extract **latent topics and lexicons** from depression-related social media data. It supports identifying key themes such as **stress, domestic violence, and gender inequality**, contributing toward **mental health cause detection**.

## 🎯 Objective

To extract **topic-based lexicons** from merged depression-labeled datasets using unsupervised learning with LDA, enabling better understanding and classification of depression causes.

## 🧪 Repository Content

- `merged_Depression_lda.html`  
  👉 An **interactive visualization** of extracted LDA topics (viewable in browser)

- `LDA_Lexicon_Visualization.png`  
  👉 A **snapshot image** of key topics and terms generated by the LDA model

- `LDA_Model_Code.ipynb` *(optional if added)*  
  👉 Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, model fitting, and pyLDAvis generation

## 🧠 Methodology

- Preprocessed text using tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal  
- Applied **LDA** to identify dominant word clusters (topics)  
- Generated **interactive HTML and static image** for lexicon exploration

## 🔍 Use Case

This lexicon can assist in:
- Improving supervised classifiers by adding **cause-related features**
- Understanding thematic patterns in mental health discourse
- Enabling lexicon-based rule extraction

## 📎 Notes

- The `.html` file must be opened in a **web browser** for interactivity  
- Data was derived from a **merged annotated classification dataset** (DM for access)
